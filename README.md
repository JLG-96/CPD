# CPD Yr Wyddgrug
CPD Yr Wyddgrug are a newly formed club within the small market town of _Mold_ (Yr Wyddgrug in Welsh) located in North Wales. This site hopes to help keep the fan base of the club up to date with upcoming fixtures, recent results as well as the current league standing. 
As it is a newly formed club, this site also hopes to help broaden the landscapes of the clubs following and reach people outside the town of _Mold_. This site will provide updates on recent news events conducted by the club and also offer people the chance to buy club merchandise.

## Features
- **Navigation Bar**
    - The navigation bar is featured on all 3 pages of the site. It is styled with the home colours of the club. The navigation bar is fixed to the top of the page and is fully responsive. It includes links to the _Logo_, _Home_, _News_ and _Get in touch_ page. It is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation between pages.
    - This section of the site will allow any user to navigate between all 3 pages with ease on any device. The design will mean the user can navigate without the use of the 'back' button, which will hopefully improve UX.

*The code institues **Love Running** project helped provide; the main part of the structure for the website, the footer, navigation bar, formatting of the pictures within the "News" page and the form on the "Get In Touch! page.*



## Testing
The website has been sufficiently tested. The websites links within the navigation bar and footer have been tested and work. The website has shown to be responsive on different devices and the form on the "Get In Touch!" page works (will not submit unless all fields correctly filled). 
- The above has been tested on the following:
    - Chrome and Edge on PC
    - Safari on Mobile and tablet

- The website looks good on the different devices and browsers with the responsiveness styling working as intended.
- Getting the rival club badges to **not** overfill it's element section when using smaller devices was difficult. However, with the use of the *code institute* programme I was able to apply the correct styling so that it fits nicely in a column.
![Screenshot of fixture list fitting in columns for smaller screens](image-13.png)

- Getting the hover element to show different text depending on the photo that was clicked proved to be difficult, however, with the implementation of several different *div* elements, the help of the *code institute* programme and *W3Schools* this was able to be achieved. 

- On the landing page, there was originally a textbox inlcuding information "Home: Gwernymyndd Village Hall". However, it was a struggle to come to a distinct conclusion on colouring that didn't contrast or look out of place so it was decided best, to be removed fully. This could be revisited and reapplied under a new update.


#### Validator Testing
- HTML
    - No errors were returned when passing each page through the official W3C validatior (https://validator.w3.org/).

- CSS
    - No errors were discovered when passing through the official CSS validator (https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).

#### Unfixed bugs
- Additionally, on screen sizes 993 - 1150px the hover comments on the "Pre-season" section of images are squashed and become unreadable. On larger devices it can be read as intended. 
    - This bug has been left for the mean time as the main purpose of this section was for use of largest devices, and it works, I can't appear to implement an effective change which corrects the bug without having an unfortunate knock on effect on the design on it's intended device size.
- On the "News" section, black spacing appears between the images (576px and more) and this does suit the overall 'feel' of the website. It would be nice if this empty space could be filled with information headings or the club logo, depending on screen-size. Will be looked to be implemented in future update. 
    - This bug has come about becuase of the need to segrogate the different sections for the images for the hover text to work. It has been decided that the hover functionality for larger devices is important in order for the viewer to know what *"news"* is being shown in the imagery. The black spacing is an unfortunate but accepted bug, and a new-way to showcase the imagery can be looked at in future to address this issue.
